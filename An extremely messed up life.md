Posting in the hopes that she'll see it.

I'm a guy from the neighboring Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

There's a girl who unintentionally entered my heart, but I can't fathom her thoughts.

She's indeed gentle, the most innocent, na√Øve, and the girl I most want to protect among all I've met. She's kind to everyone, but often isn't treated kindly in return, and she doesn't have many true friends.
I used to see her going to the cafeteria alone, eating alone, then returning to the classroom to laugh and joke with classmates. At that time, I felt this girl was somewhat pitiable, yet quite adorable.

Before the college entrance examination, she really helped me a lot. Slowly, my relationship with her became quite good (purely platonic).

But friendships from our middle school days, without the forced connection named 'class', tend to dissipate. This isn't strange; many people meet at the right moment and part ways at the right time. I think that's perfectly normal.

After the college entrance exams, learning that she didn't do well, I felt unexpectedly heartbroken. Although she's usually laughing and joking, sometimes she's as sad as a child, hiding in a closet to escape the world, walking alone on long, distant roads, and going home late by herself.

But, by a twist of fate, I wasn't a winner in the college entrance exams either.
I ended up at Nanshan, just a few kilometers away from her every day.

It's funny and regrettable that, though we're not far apart, we haven't seen each other since the exams. I've invited her out a few times as a friend, to no avail. I'm quite resigned to it; after all, I'm not her best friend or most important person.

But if our relationship isn't significant, why does she always share her life with me?

She says she likes ice but often gets a stomachache after eating it;
She says she doesn't get along well with her family, doesn't like her sister;
She claims to like The Little Prince, but I'm not sure if that's true or false;
She's saddened by her rebellious past, likes being alone.
She says her best friend is really good to her, and I'm happy for her.
She likes hawthorn, sweet potato chips, chestnut chocolate, and I've secretly noted it down.
She says she doesn't know how to handle friendships.
She can't distinguish between the solar and lunar calendars, asked me to remember her birthday, and I thought of giving her two gifts...
...
I know she has a weak stomach, often telling her to eat less ice, less spicy food;
I often look at the photos she shares with me, from the details of her home to every symbol in her neighborhood, to everything in her school, even though she shows them to me over and over;
I know her once close friends have gradually left her, and I feel a bit sad for her;
I don't like her apologizing, I also hope she can get angry;
This semester, I often stayed up late for experiments, and she frequently chatted with me until midnight. I know it might be because she's reluctant to sleep early;
Once, she rehearsed very late, and I, fighting sleepiness, chatted with her, hoping to make her feel a bit better.
...

Is this feeling beyond friendship? Is it my self-delusion? I don't know.

I vaguely know that we are each other's special concern, we both have nicknames for each other. I also know that we chat the most frequently among our friends.

In my first year, most of my energy was on academics for the sake of grades and honors. But she often messaged me, and I frequently replied, even if I was busy and replied hours later, she still shared her bits and pieces with me. But I overlooked the hidden emotions in this behavior and the habit formed from her every share, until my friend told me:

'If a girl is willing to share all her details with you, that's beyond the boundaries of friendship.'

So I wanted to cross that boundary.
I thought of an opportunity to prove this is a bond of the soul, to prove this feeling is higher than liking.

I subtly revealed my thoughts, but she jokingly told me to pursue other girls from time to time.
I told her not to say that anymore, but she just laughed it off.

I once suggested we hang out on New Year's Day, but she said it was too far away and we'd talk about it later. Later, she took CET-4 and I took CET-6. I cheered her on and said we'd discuss the New Year's plan after the exams.

We used to talk about everything, from the past to the future, from sadness to happiness, from every

 meal in life to future plans.

Actually, I wanted to clearly express my feelings, but I didn't want to discuss such important matters online.

I wanted to confess to her face to face.

But the opportunity was delayed again and again, and she ultimately didn't respond to my request for a meeting.

Actually, I'm not someone who can keep taking the initiative. Every initiative is carefully considered in front of the screen. I'm afraid of bothering her, afraid of being abrupt. The messages I typed were repeatedly deleted, and I stared at the screen for a long time before gathering the courage to send them.

It's just a long wait. Two completely different attitudes emerged in these few days, for unknown reasons, unclear results.

My cold fingertips hesitated on the enter key, laughing at myself for being so timid. From the start of caring to now, I feel like I'm no longer myself.

I'm tired. I've been distressed, fearless, self-doubting, courageous, and have pondered over the chat box, what exactly does this count as youth?

It's such a pity.
I couldn't show you the mullet head I saved.
I couldn't treat you to a meal with my scholarship money generously.
I couldn't invite you to a movie.
I couldn't take you to Happy Valley,
I couldn't take you to walk the ancient streets of Nanshan and see the splendid night view.
I couldn't tell you the most romantic words in the world.
I couldn't see the changes in you these past two years.
I couldn't buy you delicious food, even though I know all your favorite snacks, fruits, and junk food.
I couldn't know if you are really my rose, you tamed your Little Prince, but still let the Little Prince leave.
I couldn't be there to care for you when you have a stomachache, to be by your side for a real reason.
So many regrets, it feels like I can't say them all at once. But they're unspeakable.

When you apologize, you always call me 'brother.' Actually, having a sister like that is pretty good.

But in the future, you should apologize less, eat less ice, less spicy food, stay up less late, think less of the past, make more friends, read more books, don't endure when your stomach hurts, take medicine when you're sick, don't hold back when you're sad, don't cry, don't get angry, don't be gentle to everyone anymore.

No matter what, I just hope you're happy and joyful. Although I really want to be part of your future, silence and silence, probably mean a silent refusal.

Where does this regret come from?
This reminds me of '5 Centimeters per Second,' the memories of cherry blossoms fluttering by, always feeling like an indescribable, faint sadness.

If you see this, please 'shush,' quietly, let's leave the silence to each other, let the memories naturally fade.
If you don't see it, then it's such a pity, in the end, my words can't reach your heart.

Let me retreat to the past, no longer thinking about the future.

(I don't know if the wall can be posted on a few more times for her to see. She might be too silly to look at these. Her name is WS, a simpleton. If any friend knows her, could you please pass this on to her, as my impolite request?)'

#### Second journal entry
```
I cannot heal the fragility in my heart, nor can I erase the pain of others.
Superfluous words cannot change the outcome, and cumbersome text cannot convey true emotions.
```

#### Third short story
```
 I want to tell a story.
But no one wants to hear what I say. Perhaps as a big cat, my joys and sorrows don't align with humans, unless they have food I like.
Speaking of which, I'm just a wanderer, meaning I don't stay in one place for long. Once, I passed by Huangqiao Ya in Nanshan.
The old street of Huangqiao Ya in Nanshan lights up at night like the ever-awake Chang'an of the legends. Those who come and go are groups of companions, curiously posing in various odd ways, then saying 'cheese.' But I don't care. The antique tiles and beams and the all-night lanterns are just another form of loneliness and unease.

But I took interest in a boy because he was carrying a pancake. I admit I was hungry, dragging my fat, lazy body, tiptoeing along the shadows of the walls towards him.
He walked slowly, holding a bottle of Jiang Xiaobai.
He had medium-length hair and a glint in his eyes.
I could tell his naivety from his light, staggering walk.
But I didn't understand: the slight glint in his eyes made all the stars of the night sky change sides.
I approached him, and our joys and sorrows resonated (because he had food I liked). He saw and acknowledged me, squatting down to rub my head and belly, sharing a small portion of his pancake with me.
I was overjoyed, listening to him talk a lot.
He said, 'It's hard to like a girl, only to let her go.' But what is liking?
He said, 'Liking someone feels very sad.' Why is that?
He said, 'There's this girl who helps you through the toughest times, shares the happiest moments with you, is open with you on the most private topics, from the past to the future, from family to friends, from the appearance of childhood to the carefully drawn eyebrows of today.'
He said, 'She showed you her childhood photos, telling you, 'You're all I have left.' She asks you to supervise her spending, constantly reminding you of her favorite fruit. She likes stars and The Little Prince, she likes purple and plush toys, she's been like a shadow following you for the past few years, unknowingly becoming a part of your life...'
He said, 'I never thought I'd be so down and out. Lost the courage to read each line of text. At moments, breathing feels painful, and the gaze gradually loses focus. So I chose to ignore and block out, thinking that not seeing is escaping.'
He said, 'I want to give her a sky full of stars.'
He said, 'I really want to be related to her future, to spend the future with her.'
He said, 'But, but it's really impossible now.'
Actually, I was full, and I didn't care about what he said. But I wanted to stay quiet for a while, partly to listen to his joys and sorrows, partly to digest my food.
I stretched lazily, he rubbed my head again, then stood up and walked into the crowd.
He left behind an empty bottle of Jiang Xiaobai. I sniffed it; indeed, it didn't taste good. He must be very sad! Very desperate!
I say I understand, but it's actually because if I hadn't eaten just now, I might have starved to death (I've probably been wandering in the corners of the city for many days). So it seemed like I was redeemed.
I am a big cat, a wanderer. His joys and sorrows were passed to me, in the form of food. But that's not the point, the point is our joys and sorrows are actually the same. But I guess if I tell you, you wouldn't understand.
I'm leaving, probably won't see him again.
Not seeing has its benefits, but the story is actually still early.
That's why I wanted to tell this story because it responds to another story.

#### Next journal entry: How does one truly grow?
```
In my high school days, I was fond of literature, idolizing authors who often declared their lives through suicide. I loved standing on the rooftop of the school building, often with one foot dangling over the edge, wondering what would happen if the other foot followed. A favorite poet of mine, Shuntaro Tanikawa, wrote in 'The Death Ship':

'...
I remember, there was indeed such a feeling - it‚Äôs clearly one's own matter, yet it feels as if it belongs to someone else.
In high school, I thought about ending my life, standing on the roof of the school building.
A single step forward could have obliterated my existence.
Yet, I wondered if I could truly erase myself?
I felt like a side character in a comic book, walking down the stairs...
...'

At that age, everything seemed inconsequential, not out of depression, but because neither life nor death felt real. The biggest worries of youth revolve around love, the future, and the joys of yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
I believed life should be brilliant, like fireworks, fleeting yet worthwhile.
I thought I hadn't changed over the years, but I've realized I have. Perhaps for better, perhaps for worse.
I thought I wouldn't experience repeated joys and sorrows for anyone again, yet I'm just an ordinary person with emotions and desires.
Visiting my hometown during Qingming Festival to pay respects at ancestral graves, I realized when the closest of kin pass away, it does bring pain and significance; what I once thought of as a personal liberty regarding death, now seems interconnected with many others' joys and sorrows. Is it the bonds that bring sorrow? Only now do I gradually feel the warmth supposed to be in familial relationships, and it all comes to an abrupt end. Am I to blame for growing too slowly or realizing too late?
I have regrets.
About family, not spending enough time with them. About friends, many drifted apart due to time or misunderstandings. About love, adhering to purity in my heart, unwilling to compromise.
A good friend from junior to high school, lost over a single argument, not speaking another word, even though we were in the same class for three years. Looking back, the source of the argument was neither her fault nor mine, but rather pride unwilling to bow. What should have been a joyous old friendship ended prematurely. Intentionally or not, I distanced myself from other friends connected to her, out of youthful arrogance.
What I feared most over the years was looking back with regret. Yet, regret has indeed happened.
On a whim, I took a taxi to the neighboring school. It was closer than I thought. My visit wasn't for the school itself, but because she might be there. I wandered near the school gates for half an hour, not sure whom I was waiting for. Probably just a fool, trying my luck during holidays. Peering through the fence, watching the playground, the teaching buildings, the few stalls and grocery stores at the gate, places she might have walked through. Seeing this school similar in size to her high school, I guess that's why she was reluctant to talk more about her school that summer! It started to rain, reminding me there was no need to stay longer.
I worry about her, feel sorry for her. She's a good girl; I fear she might go astray, be bullied, or be lonely. But I have no right to intervene, can only foolishly let go. So many things have happened; I blame my own overstepping and greed. If the outcome is fixed, whether I speak or not, whether we meet or not, she's destined to be my regret.
The best, best, best friend, perhaps I don't deserve her.
'Rather than comforting each other, it's better to forget each other in the world!'
So, even greedy algorithms have unsolvable problems.

Coming to this university is probably the luckiest thing for me! Meeting like-minded friends and ideal teachers, one who's willing to sit down and listen to dreams about a utopian world.
Cats, cherry blossoms, and the fallen streets, and a library that wraps everything in its embrace.
What kind of person will I become?
I don't know.
Just like my longing for Platonic love, how long can such a conviction last? Even if I am an actor in my own emotional drama, if I don't devote time and soul to a sincere emotion, wouldn't that completely negate my former self?
Or, looking at the words I once wrote, phrases like 'I will never regret,' don't they still embarrass me for my youthful naivety?
Or, observing more of the wrinkled corners of my relatives' eyes and their graying hair, when the days of rebellion are gone, might I find the noisy world boring, preferring the tranquility of home?

In this fast-food era, I probably don't fit in.
So, I'll stop here! Consider this a rant during a boring vacation, and a testament to my life.
```
#### And Next
```
S, today is your birthday! Happy Birthday!
Another year older, time flies, doesn't it? After this summer, you'll be a junior. I originally wanted to give you a gift, but firstly, I don't know if you're still on campus for exams or if you've gone home for the holidays. Secondly, the gift might not be to your liking. Moreover, our relationship is a bit delicate, so I'll just send you my best wishes! But with so many friends, you probably won't miss my wishes.

Take good care of yourself, and don't be silly all day. Be happy and carefree every day. Oh, and drink less cold beverages, take care of your stomach, and be careful not to catch a cold from the air conditioning in the summer. Don't overexert yourself, and protect yourself when you're out and about.

Well, I wish you to remain as cute as ever, with your childlike innocence intact, and to experience endless happiness every day. May you eat the sweetest cake, blow out the candles, and make your most desired wish; may you be healthy, happy, and beautiful; may you stay pure, carefree, and innocent; may your world be flawlessly beautiful; may all your wishes come true.

(Lastly, it's a bit surprising that your lunar birthday falls on Xiaoshu.)

The thought that I can't be a part of your life in the future brings me an unusual amount of distress. You're willful, rebellious, and don‚Äôt know how to take care of yourself, like a child, yet I can‚Äôt get close to you again. I really, really want to message you, to hear your voice again, but my rationality forces me to suppress every fantasy. I can't learn to be abject, can't stand my own aloof stance, probably losing courage every minute. If the story could start over, that night I wouldn't have asked you how to write an English essay, wouldn‚Äôt have chosen to meet you.

#### letter
```
S:
How have you been lately?
I received your text. When I saw your monologue that morning, my first reaction was to turn off my phone for ten minutes, hesitant to touch those words.

We haven't really communicated well, and you never gave me a chance to speak properly. But you don't know, it's not your rejection that hurt me the most.

That summer two years ago, when you said your school was in Nanshan, do you know how happy I was! I thought it must be a fate indulged by the heavens.
But do you remember that summer? You said if I came to Fuling, you'd meet me. Later, when I went, you didn't show up. It made me realize our friendship was just so-so. You didn't know, I waited all day for your message, for your explanation. But all I got was prolonged disappointment.
I thought: "It's good to end things this way!" But it didn't end, and I believed your so-called explanations, because why insist on something with a mere acquaintance!

Then, in college. You often shared your troubles with me. I remember many things, day after day, and I wanted to give you more kindness. You're really like a child who never grows up, sometimes speaking nonsense. I watched your clumsiness with tenderness, silly but adorable. A real fool, happily foolish every day. Sometimes you were sad like a child, heartbreakingly so. Sometimes you were unwell, and all I could say was for you to rest well. Gradually, you became a habit to me.

At the end of 2019, one day you urgently told me Bai Ping unfriended you. Seeing you helpless and abandoned, I really felt sorry for you, indignant on your behalf. You finally told me: "Now I only have you." That moment, I thought, I must protect you for life, whether as a friend or a brother, to be there for you when you're most scared, sad, and clueless. I thought even if your friends aren't there, you'd remember me, so you wouldn't feel sad or lost.

Early 2020, a lot happened. That period was the saddest and most vulnerable in my life. If I hadn't gotten through it, I probably wouldn't have the courage to go on. Unintentionally, you healed me. You showed me the pastries you made, your sister's cat, and all the happy things in your eyes. For my birthday, you sent me a gift, wrote a lot in the letter ‚Äì I remember it all. Fool, and a photo of you as a child. Receiving that gift, I felt so lucky to have such a sister. You're so cute and silly, and I sincerely wanted to be your lifelong friend, to stay by your side.

Actually, my thoughts are simple. I don't want to date now because I've always yearned for a pure relationship. So when a girl confessed to me in college, I rejected her. She said: "I don't know what you're still waiting for." It hurt, and I didn't understand what I was waiting for. At that time, you weren't the answer; you were just a silly little sister.

Then summer, then sophomore year, time really flies. Do you remember? My roommate asked me for the confession wall of your college, and then I asked you. Later, you added him and asked for my photo. Do you know what my roommate said? "Aren't you two close friends? Why does she want your photo?" I was stunned, realizing we hadn't seen each other for a long time. Why is that? Even though we're not far apart daily.

This unease grew stronger.
I also realized, our circles don't intersect, maintaining our friendship until now is a miracle. Without intersecting lives, will we drift apart? I'm actually afraid of this happening. In fact, one day, this friendship will end, with no new bonds, depleting time and words, leaving only silence.

What can I do? I want to be your good friend, but I seem not to be. I'm envious of your best friends, even your former classmates. They can invite you out, but I can't, even though we entrust each other with our innermost thoughts. Soulmates? Or is our relationship not as unique as I thought?

Our non-intersecting lives make me anxious. So do you know why I wanted to meet you? You're a fool, you don't think so much. You don't think that there's a bond higher than love between us, that is, mutual salvation. You don't think that what I want is companionship, not just romance.

You know, I just wanted an answer from you. A confirmation of this friendship, or a relationship higher than friendship and love. You thought I'd confess without hesitation, that my liking you would ruin our relationship. You don't know that I just wanted to see you, to see how you've changed.

Do you know? Your rejection made me feel that everything that happened between us was a false lie. You made me feel that I'm not your best friend, that I'm dispensable to you, that our mutual confessions and salvations were just a joke.

So, your twice refusal to meet me left me at a loss. Maybe I'm really not your best friend.
Funny and absurd, right? Fool, you said you refused me to have a longer companionship. But you don't know I also wanted a longer companionship. Is this a kind of tacit understanding?

In the end, your unease and mine were the same, but it still turned out this way, and I don't know what to do. After that, I realized I probably lost the most important thing in my life, irretrievably.

If this friendship and liking are not worth cherishing, are false, lies, fantasies, hatred, past you don't want to face, then what can I do? Other than silently leaving, what can I do? When the turmoil in my heart can't stir a ripple in your soul, what can I do but leave?

I deleted you, that's my cowardice. Because I don't want my presence to restrain your joy and happiness. I really don't want you to be unhappy.

You don't know, I actually went to your school this semester. For some reason, I even went inside. You don't know, I walked through your teaching buildings, playground, cafeteria, imagining the stairs and corridors you once walked, but I never saw you. No one knew what I was thinking then. I thought, if I met you, I'd hug you and say sorry, no matter what. Fate really does play tricks on everyone.

I don't know what the future will be like. Is there even a future? I can't help but mock myself. Anyway, I admit I really like you. You're not the most beautiful or outstanding girl I've met, but you are the girl who moves me the most, whom I want to protect the most. Not being able to properly tell you I like you will be a regret I'll never forget.

From the first glance at you, I knew you weren't the type of girl I'm good with. You're really the simpleton sent by the heavens to torment me. But what of it? Helplessly charmed by you.

It rains a lot in Nanshan. Remember not to catch a cold, not to get wet in the rain, to eat well, and to sleep well.

I'm sending you some snacks as an apology for deleting you. I know you might hate me, that you might have lost a friend, but I might have lost my most cherished friendship, probably a fair trade. What will happen in the future, I don't know, just like you.
```
#### Journal
```
S, I suddenly feel like I'm no longer so heartbroken. I seem to have calmly accepted the loss of you and what I thought was our most sincere bond. Time slowly polishes my soul, making me thinner, duller, unable to recall your goodness.

I will probably forget you, in a year, two years, three years. How long can I remember you? I can hardly recall your voice, and without a photo, I'm quickly forgetting your face. I guess I don't like you anymore.

As I expected, we're about to graduate without realizing it. Lives heading in different directions, there's no reason to hold each other back anymore. How much should I miss you?

How much did it hurt back then? Almost suffocating! Every sleepless night, remembering the past, it was really painful.

No one is kind to someone for no reason.
I really liked you.
I'm not trying to show how deeply I felt, I just really, really liked you. I'll never meet a girl like you again. I'll never feel so deeply for another girl.

I know you're a good girl, I know you're trying hard. I hope you can become very good, always happy, always joyful. You must be happy!
```

#### Final Journal Entry: To You in My Memories
```
I know these words could be directly sent to you, but I once vowed not to use them as a means to trouble you. So, whether you see this or not, if you ask, it's not from me.

Two years ago, I left a blank space here.

Reflecting on these four years of college, nearly half the time I was trapped in unrequited love.

A few kilometers' distance is nothing, but some distances, since that hurried farewell in the rainy summer after the college entrance exams, are longer than the 'twenty billion years of loneliness.' Nanshan is small, our schools are close, but we are far apart.

You know, if it weren't for that accidental glance at the crowd, even if we met, we would just be people who glanced at each other.

I'm heading to a faraway city for graduate studies, admitted to one of the top universities in East China. My only two fortunes in my senior year are getting into the university of my choice and reconnecting with you.

You must have realized, no matter how hard we try, there will always be an irreparable rift between us.

Even though I want to get closer to you again, an instinctive protective mechanism prevents me from taking any further steps.

After all, it seems like many people in the world don't believe in so-called love, thinking that a bit more affection is devalued. But I don't care, because I truly liked you.

What does it really mean to like someone?

If you feel resonance, familiarity, pity, respect, jealousy, and emotions beyond these for a girl, it's certainly more than just liking.

I hate ambiguity, hate lies.

Perhaps no one told you, special settings are for special people. Special notes are given special meanings. Since that's the case, you shouldn't have given these to me, you don't understand the weight of 'being different.'

I don't want this relationship to be a shallow and childish flirtation, so I hurried to respond. That childish rashness now fills me with regret, but the outcome leaves me speechless.

There were many chances to make amends, and your actions indeed angered me. I'm also unclear about your definition of liking.

After you, there was decadence, depression, reconciliation, and rejuvenation. I can't find the words to describe my feelings then, so I silently devoted myself to academics and life. We tacitly stopped holding onto each other.

In 'Little Women,' Laurie says to Jo, "You'll meet someone you love more than life, and because it's your nature, you will... and I can only watch."

I once borrowed a book from you about princes, princesses, elves, and dragons. The story was beautiful, I really liked it! But time faded the title and content from my memory. Maybe time really does cleanse everything.

I've told many lies, like "retreating to the past" or "remaining friends in the future," but they were just lies to you and myself. But that last part was true: "You must be happy!"

I admit I'm not good enough, not outstanding enough. But in my eyes, you are a very good girl. You don't need to be unconfident, unhappy. You're the best girl in the world, deserving of the greatest happiness.

Are you my unattainable love? But I feel more like you're the rose in 'Le Petit Prince.'

My world was cold, hypocritical, false, and filled with indescribable sadness, but it warmed up because of your innocence, purity, kindness, and sincerity.

I still believe our bond is more pure, sincere, profound, and unforgettable than mere 'liking.'

That was my truest feeling of affection for a girl.

But I'm not writing this for you to see, but for my own farewell. Although I've decided countless times before, this time I seem to truly let go.

My heart stops me from begging for your pity, and the suppressed emotions fade in silence. I can still recall that passion but no longer have the courage to take another step.

For a moment, I think I understand. I was just there when you needed care, during that confusing, fragile, helpless time. We both mistakenly thought that was the best bond. But to you, I'm not the most important. Because it's not important, anything goes, no need to care or promise anymore.

I'm about to head to a distant place, pursuing a genuine love in a future without you.

Although it's unnecessary to repeat that meaningless confession, I really wanted to tell you in person: "Back then, I really, really liked you."

Unspoken confessions, untransmitted affection, unfelt sincerity.

I'm fortunate to have met you, even if there's no possibility of meeting again. But why can I still remember that gathering after the college entrance exams four years ago?

Your long hair, white dress, sitting beside me. I said I'd never seen you in a dress, and you shyly said you liked lotus root slices in hot pot. At the school gate, you leaned against a tree, the streetlight illuminating your face, casting shadows on your black hair.

Actually, I almost can't remember what you look like in my memory.

Your messy hair was actually nice
I didn't like your carefree nature
You were like a child when you were sad
You scored higher in science than English a few times
You looked cute leaning against the window
When you said "I only have you," my heart skipped a beat

You never told me how to treat these memories. Four years can blur many details, but raw emotions leave scars. Turing's world stores only coded sequences, but how do we preserve attached emotions?

I should have understood, so-called lies eventually become poison. Romeo drank the poison, and everlasting love became a shackle.

If I could choose again, I wish I hadn't stayed in the classroom after self-study on that Friday night, hadn't asked you about English, hadn't walked with you after school. Then, I wouldn't have become close to you.

Actually, writing this, I feel it doesn't matter. Although there's much to say, let it be. Elaborate words can't compare to an unsaid "like." But in the future, probably no longer liking.

Actually, I realized early on that you're becoming insignificant in my memory. But my subconscious tells me it shouldn't be like this. You were the violet in my life, forgetting is torture for me.

Later, it seemed we returned to the starting point. But as Marx's philosophy states, the negation of negation is not the starting point, but a new, unfamiliar, different shore.

Yes, I feel the strangeness from time and space, not towards you or me, but towards that once thought inseparable fate.

Perhaps you're not what I'm looking for. In the moment of reunion, I see your changes and mine. Maybe we're not the indispensable ones for each other. We were really close to the purest bond, but unfortunately, it wasn't so.

You're gentle to everyone, just too gentle to me. I got used to your goodness, but ignored your flaws. So naively thought it was your unique taste.

I envy the person who will meet you in the future. Envy him for meeting you at the right time. For me, crossing timelines is not a perfect encounter, love also has flaws!

But I don't understand your world, you don't seem to understand mine. I don't want to entangle these unclear emotions, nor be your close friend.

I can still laugh with you, sit down quietly to listen to you, indulge your whims and mischief.

But there's a wall in my heart, I curl up inside, not daring to come out. I no longer have the eagerness to see you, knowing it's not dislike, but time reminding me to leave.
Yes
I'm leaving, probably won't come back for a long time. A farewell without clinging, take care of yourself!

It's a silent dialogue, perhaps the rose is not in my hands.
You're not my rose, and I will eventually leave B612.
You haven't tamed me, little fox!

I hope one day you understand your likes and earnestly pursue them. Thus, there will be no regrets.

"Perhaps the destiny's sign only lets us meet"

The secret I can't tell!

I swear I'll never mention these words to you again, let it be my caprice! If I can't be the only one in your life, please let me go!

Thank you for being in my life, I'll sincerely play the role of a good friend you wish for!

[No more words of joy or sorrow, No more ties, and No more meetings!]
